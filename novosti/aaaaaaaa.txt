A train is a form of rail transport consisting of a series 
of vehicles that usually runs along a rail track to transport 
cargo or passengers. Motive power is provided by a separate 
locomotive or individual motors in self-propelled multiple 
units. Although historically steam propulsion dominated, the 
most common modern forms are diesel and electric locomotives,
 the latter supplied by overhead wires or additional rails. 
Other energy sources include horses, rope or wire, gravity, 
pneumatics, batteries, and gas turbines. Train tracks usually 
consists of two, three or four or five rails, with a limited 
number of monorails and maglev guideways in the mix.[1] The word 
'train' comes from the Old French trahiner, from the Latin trahere 'pull, draw'
